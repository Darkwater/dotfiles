dotfiles
========

Most of my dotfiles. This repository is meant as a central repository to sync dotfiles between my laptop/desktop/vps, and most stuff will possibly break on your setup if you don't change anything.

I use tint2 version 652 as panel, dzen2 for [info-panel](http://github.com/Darkwater124/info-panel) and screentool, dock (included) to position windows, dmenu2 as application launcher, compton as compositor.
dock requires wmctrl, xprop, xwininfo, xrandr.

fish uses fortune for greeting, has get/search/show/update/upgrade/remove(/purge) aliases for yaourt (arch/manjaro) and apt-get (anything else (only works on debian/ubuntu obviously))

lock uses imagemagick, [maim](http://github.com/naelstrof/maim), i3lock and conky.

screentool uses maim, [slop](http://github.com/naelstrof/slop), ffmpeg and scp to upload.

There's more I should tell you but I'm too lazy to write everything down right now. Yell at me if you want to use something but it won't work. I'm in #novaember on Freenode.
